Description
Although arugula has been grown since ancient times, only recently has this member of the cabbage family (it looks like lettuce though) gotten the attention it deserves for its bold, peppery flavor. It's easy to grow, so plan on planting some so you can toss it into your salads and other dishes. Make sure to harvest the leaves while young. (Mature leaves tend to be bitter.)
